Problem 1:
Use the PairOfDice class created in Homework 9 as superclass to create a subclass TrioOfDice.
Add a new die in the TrioOfDice. Create two constructors TrioOfDice(), which makes three random dice; and TrioOfDice(int, int, int), which makes three dice with input values. Add printValue method in both PairOfDice and TrioOfDice to print out values of all dice.

Problem 2:
Write a method
void evenBeforeOdd(int[])
This method will rearrange a given array of integers so that the even numbers appear before the odd numbers. The original order does not have to be kept.
Example:
[1, 2, 3, 4] => [4, 2, 1, 3] ([2, 4, 3, 1] is also ok because order does not matter)
[2, 3, 3, 8, 1] => [2, 8, 3, 3, 1]
