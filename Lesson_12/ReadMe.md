Problem 1:
Write a method to convert all the Strings in a ArrayList<String> to upper case:
public static void toUpper(ArrayList<String> als)
You can add this method in the same class where your main method is in.
You need to test the method in the main method.

Problem 2:
Write a method to merge two integer arrays with ascending order into a single array with ascending order. The returned array is the merged array:
public static int[] merge(int[] a1, int[] a2)
For example,
a1 = [1, 3, 5], a2 = [2, 4, 6] => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
a1 = [2, 8, 9, 15], a2 = [1, 10] => [1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 15]
a1 = [], a2 = [4, 6, 100] => [4, 6, 100]
You need to test the method in the main method.
